"""0.2.1 -- the omission sweep, block 6 (`../0.2.0_tools/sweep.py`, its pathspec this plan's): a
comparator proves the run equals the rehearsal and cannot see a hunk the rehearsal never wrote, so this reads the
committed tree for statements of what the steps moved. TWO READINGS of every pattern, because one line-based reading
cannot see a phrase a line break splits, and the joined reading cannot point at a line by itself:

  line    -- `git grep -n -I -i -E` at HEAD, line by line, case-insensitive
  joined  -- each tracked file read whole, each line's leading comment marker (`//`, `#`, `*`, `>`) stripped, the
             lines joined with spaces, and the pattern matched across them, case-insensitive; a hit is reported at
             the line it starts on

    python3 -B sweep.py <repo> <out-file> <pattern-file> [decisions]

The pattern file holds one ERE per line (`#` lines are comments). The pathspec is fixed below: the live tree, history
excluded -- and `meta/DECISIONS.md` with it, unless the fourth argument is `decisions`, since a settled decision is
read with its dated notes, never rewritten. It prints one line per pattern -- `<n> line hits, <m> joined hits, <k>
joined-only` -- and writes every hit to <out-file> as `<pattern#> <reading> <path>:<line>: <text>`, which the worker
READS, every line. Only the counts are compared; the reading is the check.
